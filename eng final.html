    <h2> Annual Fourth of July firework show celebrates Vietnam War, soldiers </h3>
        <h4> By: Sarah Green</h4>
        <h5> The event in the small town of Bruce, Wis. featured speeches given by community members.</h5>
        <p>The 1969 annual firework show in the local town of Bruce, Wis. featured its usual display of brightly colored lights in the evening on July 4. Many residents set up their chairs facing away from Amacoy Lake where they watched mayor Leonard Boyd, chief police commissioner Zachary Erik and Marie Blake speak about the Vietnam War. Blake is the president of the town’s only school district’s PTA.
        </p>
        <p>“The lake was beautiful at night with all the firework lights reflecting off of it,” Blake said. “I’m so glad we had the opportunity to dedicate a fun event to an important topic. It really brings the community together.”
        </p>
        <p> The event comes after president Richard Nixon has been slowly reeling back involvement in Vietnam since the number of troops in the Southeast Asian nation peaked earlier this year in April.
        </p>
        <p>Before the technical team in charge of the show released the fireworks, the three speakers took turns giving speeches about various aspects significant to the war.
        </p>
        <p>Blake specifically talked about the struggles of those returning from war to Bruce and how the small town’s community can support them. 
        </p>
        <p>“The former soldiers in our community are a small but important minority,” she said in the speech. “We can do so much to create statues, museum exhibits and other forms of memorial for the bravest of us.”
        </p>
        <p>After Blake’s uplifting words, Boyd’s address about the future of the town’s leadership after his upcoming retirement preceded Erik’s discussion of the importance of the war’s foundations. He explained how the morals that the US was founded on are being preserved in Vietnam.
        </p>
        <p>“The foundations of democracy that our nation was built on are of utter importance not just to the White House but to our small community here in Bruce,” Erik said in the address. “I hope you all see past the popular narrative and realize that the grim nature of the war is reflective of a greater good. You all are enjoying the benefits of our troops’ working towards maintaining democracy.”
        </p>
        <p>Leading up to the event, Blake was the primary organizer of the speaker event and firework show which drew over 400 attendees. She contracted a company to put on the firework show and invited Erik and Boyd to speak. 
        </p>
        <p> “The organization process was a bit difficult since I am new to the whole process and the logistics were quite tedious,” Blake said. “It was all worth it in the end to see so many people come together. I hope we can dedicate future events to topics like this one because that’s what the Fourth of July is really all about.”

        <h2> New burger place opens in Bruce
        </h3>
            <h4> The small Wisconsin town was chosen to be home to a new location of the A&W fast food chain.</h4>

            <p>The 1969 annual firework show in the local town of Bruce, Wis. featured its usual display of brightly colored lights in the evening on July 4. Many residents set up their chairs facing away from Amacoy Lake where they watched mayor Leonard Boyd, chief police commissioner Zachary Erik and Marie Blake speak about the Vietnam War. Blake is the president of the town’s only school district’s PTA.
            </p>
            <p>On June 20, a new location of the fast food chain A&W opened in the small town of Bruce, Wis. A&W is known for their selection of “Family Burgers” and various root beer drinks. Bruce resident Wilbur Sandford is serving as owner and manager of the store.
            </p>
            <p>Sandford first decided to apply for permission to open a restaurant after retiring from his career as a teacher. About his motivations, Sandford said, “This is a fun venture that’s a complete curveball from my previous career, so why not? And who doesn’t like burgers?”
            </p>
            <p>The A&W chain was first founded in California in 1919 when Roy Allen decided to sell root beer at a parade honoring WWII veterans. Sandford said he resonates with Allen’s dedication to helping veterans, which was also a reason behind his opening the restaurant. 
            </p>
            <p>The restaurant is also one of the first fast food establishments in the Midwest to feature intercoms through which customers can place their orders. The recent development in technology has been very convenient, Sandford told a Wisconsin Daily reporter in an interview.
            </p>
            <p>“The store workers and I are still trying to figure out how it works because it’s all new to us. Some customers even struggle with it sometimes.” Sandford. “I do think that this intercom thing has potential to make things faster in the restaurant though.”
            </p>
            <p>In less than three weeks since its opening, the restaurant has already become a local hot spot and business is booming. Sandford reported that many teenagers appreciate the spot as a convenient place to hang out, particularly after school.
            </p>
            <p>“I really do love having anyone and everyone enjoy the restaurant. It just feels great to offer something to everyone in the community,” Sandford said.
            </p>
            <p>Another way the restaurant is serving the community is through offering jobs to recently returned Vietnam War veterans, continuing the principle on which A&W was founded. Though, Sandford reported difficulties retaining workers for long periods of time leading to the restaurant being understaffed at times.
            </p>
            <p>“It has been kind of crazy lately with a lot of orders coming in and not a lot of fry cooks. We’ve had customers complain about long wait times which is a bit frustrating,” Sandford said. “Still, I’m happy to hire those who need it the most. We really want veterans to return to their normal lives.”

            <h2> America, it’s time we leave the hippie movement in the past </h3>
            <h4> By: Sarah Green</h4>
            <h5>Concert disaster reveals counterculture movement’s vulgar nature.
            </h5>
            <p>The Dec. 6 Altamont Free Concert in Tracy, Calif. drew hundreds of thousands of attendees who hoped to see big name bands like the Rolling Stones perform live. Fans were in for a shock when the concert ended with several cars being stolen, Hells Angels fighting with audience members and four dead.
            </p>
            <p>It might seem like the disaster was a well-intended concert that accidentally went wrong due to an unfortunate series of events. The truth is that the violence stemmed from a larger problem with the concert’s fans and organizers; the counterculture movement as a whole is an ugly problem in the US. 
            </p>
            <p> Take The Rolling Stones’ setlist for a prime example. A fan favorite is “Gimmie Shelter” which sums up everything you need to know about present day hippie youth. Though youth claim it is a “war anthem” and “reveals the brutal realities of war”, its lyrics cursing and screaming about war and death are truly just asking people to hit and punch each other at a concert. 
            </p>
            <p> The song is one of many counterculture tracks played at the festival that are essentially odes to violence. The entire band’s near entire discography is a violent mess corrupting listeners. Though it's easy to tunnel vision and put blame on just this concert, the entire counterculture movement is a problem responsible for a recent uptick in violence. 
            </p>
            <p>US officials have previously condemned or shut down protests and arrested protesters because they posed a risk to the peace of the public — take the UC Berkeley campus protests a few years ago for instance. Why can’t the same be done for the counterculture movement? Clearly the movement’s followers are harmful to the public so why hasn’t the US condemned it? These are the issues that should be raised as we move into a new decade.
